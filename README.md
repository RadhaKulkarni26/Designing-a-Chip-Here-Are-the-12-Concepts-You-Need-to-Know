# Designing a Chip? Here Are the 12 Concepts You Need to Know 
### Very large scale integration (VLSI) is the process of creating an integrated circuit(IC) by combining millions of transistors into a single chip. During this process, there are a few important concepts we need to understand and take into consideration. Below mentioned are the concepts used while designing:

 1. Set up time and hold time
 2. Metastability
 3. Antenna Effect
 4. Skews and Slack
 5. Signal Integrity
 6. Crosstalk Effect
 7. Electromigration
 8. Drain Punch Through
 9. Latch Up
 10. Body Effect
 11. Net Shielding
 12. Short Channel Effect
